Ever since birth, I have been ...different.
I have the ability to transform myself, at will, into a dragon.
I realize this sounds like a blessing, but the reality is the exact opposite. It’s a curse. Everyone who knows about the dragon rejects and hates me, dooming me to a lifetime of distrust and solitude.
No, this is no blessing.
For all of my seventeen years, I have thought I was the only one of my kind and the only ones who truly understood me was the moon and night sky.
At least, until I met... Him.
